==============

I am using this repository as a sample set of files, branches, and changes so that I can write a program that will inspect and further modify the repo using a Python module.

If anyone has a few moments, I'd like you to modify and add to the content here.  I have added a few hello worlds, but feel free to add anything you like, just keep the content and commit comments PG and non-proprietary since it will be used in a presentation.

*THANKS!!*

And I will give you credit on my slides and buy you a beverage at the next programming 'after event' we might be at.
